# XLSX2VCF
Converts XLSX documents into VCF (Variant Call Format) - remastered for JDK1.8  
The code is actually [from Apache](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/poi-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/poi/examples/xssf/eventusermodel/XLSX2CSV.java), but it didn't work as intended and was old. I rewrote some parts and wrote a function to make things easy!

## Usage
- Just read `Example.java` file. There is a really easy to use converter function as example
